#Random OpenGL Game Engine
I'm learning how to use OpenGL and other things such as Bullet, so this is where I put all of the development of the engine.
I hope to make a small game out of this when I get enough of the engine done!

##Requirements for Compiling
This game engine depends on:
* GLFW (For window handling)
* GLEW (For OpenGL magic)
* GLM (For its easy math functions)
* ASSIMP (For model loading)
* Bullet Physics (For physics)
* stb_image.h (For image loading)
